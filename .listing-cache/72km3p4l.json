  "description": "This 1953 wonderful Multnomah home on a generous 0.21-acre corner lot is waiting for you! A beautifully landscaped yard just blocks from charming Multnomah Village, and minutes from Hillsdale, Gabriel Park and MJCC. You'll find hardwood floors throughout with stone in the light flooded, updated kitchen. Step out onto the covered deck off the dining room and take in the sunset views of the valley. Enjoy meals on the lower-level concrete patio overlooking the lush, fenced yard full of perennials and local natives. Step back inside the fully finished, daylight lower level to enjoy a book or movie in the den in front of a gas fireplace with custom, built-in bookshelves. Or walk down the hall, to the oversized game room/third bedroom with a wood burning fireplace. Return upstairs to the main floor to the large living room; enjoying an open gas fire and retire for the evening in one of the two bedrooms on the main floor. This beautifully well cared for home with fresh paint throughout every room may be yours!",
